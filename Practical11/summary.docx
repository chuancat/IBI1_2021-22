Summary and interpretation
human and mouse: 
percentage of identical amino acids is 0.9653979238754326%
alignment score: 1490
human and random:
The percentage of identical amino acids is 0.2768166089965396%
alignment score: -351
mouse and random:
percentage of identical amino acids is 0.3114186851211076%
alignment score: -348.
some genes of human and mice are very similar, which may be used for 
necessary life activities.
Although this gene is similar, many of human amino acids are different 
from mices'.  
but alignment of this mice gene with random nearly has no difference.
