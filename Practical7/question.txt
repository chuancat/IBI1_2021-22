question:plot a boxplot of total case number in different countries on 14 
March 2020
line number:93-118
discussion: 
1.I used a new code called array which turns dataframe to list
2.from the boxplot, we found total cases of different countries on 14 
March 2020 is quite different, which makes the boxplot looks strange.
